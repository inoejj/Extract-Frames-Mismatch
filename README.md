# Extract-Frames-Mismatch

This script compares the classifier that a human labeled and the machine's prediction and extract the frames when there is a disagreement. Then a human can look at the extracted frames to judge if it is a human error or machine error.

As you can see below there are two gifs. The red dot shows when there is a disagreement. Who do you think is correct? The machine or the human scorer?
